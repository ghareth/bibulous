                 that is distributed with the language, and which
                 greatly enhances its immediate usability. This library
                 contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide
                 access to system functionality such as file I/O that
                 would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers,
                 as well as modules written in Python that provide
                 standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
                 everyday programming. Some of theses modules are
                 explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the

                 that bridges the gap between C and shell programming,
                 and is thus ideally suited for `throw-away programming'
                 and rapid prototyping. Its syntax is put together from
                 constructs borrowed from a variety of other languages;
                 most prominent are influences from ABC, C, Modula-3 and
                 Icon. The Python interpreter is easily extended with
                 new functions and data types implemented in C. Python
                 is also suitable as an extension language for highly
                 customizable C applications such as editors or window
                 managers. Python is available for various operating
                 systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX, Amoeba,
                 the Apple Macintosh O.S., and MS-DOS. This tutorial
                 introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts
                 and features of the Python language and system. It
                 helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on
                 experience, but as the examples are self-contained, the
                 tutorial can be read off-line as well. For a
                 description of standard objects and modules, see the

  abstract =     "Python is a small and easy-to-learn language with
                 surprising capabilities. It is an interpreted
                 object-oriented scripting language and has a full range
                 of sophisticated features such as first-class
                 functions, garbage collection, and exception handling.
                 Python has properties that make it especially appealing
                 for scientific programming: Python is quite simple and
                 easy to learn, but it is a full and complete language.
                 It is simple to extend Python with your own compiled
                 objects and functions. Python is portable, from Unix to
                 Windows 95 to Linux to Macintosh. Python is free, with
                 no license required even if you make a commercial
                 product out of it. Python has a large user-contributed
                 library of ``modules''. These modules cover a wide
                 variety of needs, such as audio and image processing,
                 World Wide Web programming, and graphical user
                 interfaces. In particular, there is an interface to the
                 popular Tk package for building windowing applications.
                 And now, Python has a high-performance array module
                 similar to the facilities in specialized array
                 languages such as Matlab, IDL, Basis, or Yorick. This
                 extension also adds complex numbers to the language.
                 Array operations in Python lead to the execution of
                 loops in C, so that most of the work is done at full
                 compiled speed.",

                 computations. Experiences of using an object-oriented

                 encounter [2]. We chose Scheme because it is a language
                 unfamiliar to most of the first year students, so that
                 the students with imperative programming experience
                 from school would not have an advantage over those who
                 did not. Also, it has a simple syntax which we felt
                 that students without prior programming experience
                 could easily learn. Finally, the functional paradigm
                 allows a more direct mapping of mathematical concepts
                 to programs, which fits with the mathematical emphasis
                 in our curriculum.",

  abstract =     "The emphasis on Java and other commercial languages in
                 CS1 has established the perception of computer science
                 as a dry and technically difficult discipline among
                 undecided students who are still seeking careers. This
                 may not be a big problem during an enrolment boom, but
                 in times of decreased enrolment such negative
                 perception may have a devastating effect on computer
                 science programs and therefore should not be ignored.
                 We have made our CS1 course offerings more attractive
                 to students (1) by introducing an easy to learn yet
                 effective scripting language --- Python, (2) by making
                 all course resources available in a comprehensive
                 online study pack, and (3) by offering an extensive set
                 of detailed and easy to follow self-guided labs. Our
                 custom-designed online study pack comprises a wealth of
                 new, original learning modules: extensive e-texts,
                 detailed self-guided labs, numerous sample programs,
                 quizzes, and slides. Our recent student survey
                 demonstrates that students like and prefer Python as a
                 first language and that they also perceive the online
                 study pack as very beneficial. Our ``Python First''
                 course, originally required for computer science
                 majors, has been so well received that it has been
                 recently approved as a general education science
                 elective, thus opening new recruitment opportunities
                 for the computer science major. Our ``Python First''
                 digital pack is published online at
                 http://studypack.com.",

                 programming (FP), specifically Haskell, to provide an
                 operational semantics for a domain-specific language,
                 CellML, that describes mathematical models of
                 biological processes. We analyse the benefits and
                 shortcomings of this approach, in comparison with other
                 semantic definitions for CellML.\par

                 It is our claim that using FP for our semantics results
                 in a more concise and useful artifact for describing
                 what such a model means. The use of lazy evaluation
                 removes the need to explicitly determine an evaluation
                 order for the model, resulting in a more elegant
                 interpreter. Crucially, using FP enables us to prove
                 the correctness of optimisation techniques for such
                 models. This gives us more confidence in scientific
                 deductions from simulation results. We compare the
                 Python implementation of these optimisation techniques
                 with our use of Haskell in proving their correctness.",

  abstract =     "Recursion is a concept which all computer scientists
                 should understand and be able to use but novices find
                 it difficult to master. In the School of Computer
                 Science at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits)
                 we have for a long time been concerned about how we can
                 assist our students with recursion [4, 1, 3]. One
                 thrust of our research is the study of the mental
                 models of recursion (c.f. Kahney [2]) which our first
                 year students develop. Most of our students encounter
                 recursion for the first time in our Fundamental
                 Algorithmic Concepts (FAC) course. When we originally
                 investigated the mental models of our students we noted
                 that although many of them seem to develop the viable
                 copies model there are still many that develop models
                 which are non-viable (i.e., that cannot be relied on to
                 lead to a correct result) [1]. Thus we adapted the way
                 in which recursion was introduced in FAC in 2003, 2004
                 and 2005 by introducing more complex recursive
                 algorithms earlier to help in the development of the
                 copies mental model. We then compared the mental models
                 developed by the 2003, 2004 and 2005 students to those
                 developed by the earlier group [3]. The results
                 indicate that more of the students were developing
                 viable mental models of recursion and thus that the
                 changes to our teaching were benefitting our students.
                 In 2006 we changed the programming language in which
                 our students implement algorithms to Python (from
                 Scheme). In essence the programming language was the
                 only change made as the course was still taught in a
                 ``functional'' style to emphasize the link between the
                 formal specification of a problem, the solution to the
                 problem and the program. We did, however, feel it was
                 important to assess the impact of the change on our
                 students' mental models of recursion. We thus did a
                 similar study on the 2006 students to that on earlier
                 cohorts. The students' traces from two recursive
                 algorithms were categorised into the mental models
                 previously observed [1,3] by identifying how the
                 student deals with the active flow, base case and
                 passive flow in their trace and then by combining this
                 information into an overall categorisation of the trace
                 for that algorithm. Overall the results are in line
                 with our previous results which showed that the copies
                 model is the dominant model for a recurrence relation
                 type of recursive function but that for list
                 manipulation problems some students showed an active or
                 looping model. These results indicate that our teaching
                 approach, even with the switch to Python, is assisting
                 our students in developing a viable copies mental model
                 of recursion. Such a mental model is more likely to
                 lead to correct traces of recursive algorithms. An
                 interesting new result was the emergence of a passive
                 mental model. Here the students recognised that the
                 recursive algorithm would somehow get to the base case
                 and then used the base case plus the implicit
                 definition of the function in the algorithm to build up
                 the required solution. This model may have arisen
                 because the students were given a recurrence in
                 Tutorial 1 and asked to calculate what value would be
                 returned. Solving the recurrence essentially meant
                 working up from the value where the result is defined
                 directly until the desired answer is found. Some
                 students may have adopted this as their model of
                 recursion.",

                 from the very first day of an introductory class.
                 Second, we wanted to provide seamless support for
                 intermediate and advanced lessons as students progress.
                 The resulting package is freely available at
                 www.cs1graphics.org. We find its combination of

  abstract =     "There is an ongoing debate regarding the role of
                 object orientation in the introductory programming
                 sequence. While the pendulum swings to and fro between
                 the ``objects first'' and ``back to basics'' extremes,
                 there is general agreement that object-oriented
                 programming is central to modern software development
                 and therefore integral to a computer science
                 curriculum. Developing effective approaches to teach
                 these principles raises challenges that have been
                 exacerbated by the use of Java or C++ as the first
                 instructional language. In this paper, we recommend
                 Python as an excellent choice for teaching an
                 object-oriented CS1. Although often viewed as a
                 ``scripting'' language, Python is a fully
                 object-oriented language with a consistent object model
                 and a rich set of built-in classes. Based upon our
                 experiences, we describe aspects of the language that
                 help support a balanced introduction to object
                 orientation in CS1. We also discuss the downstream
                 effects on our students' transition to Java and C++ in
                 subsequent courses.",

                 Mathematics for the Digital Age and Programming in
                 Python: ``The vision behind this book is that math and
                 computer science should help each other. A programmer
                 needs to be comfortable with abstractions, and that is
                 precisely what math teaches. Computer science
                 reciprocates by providing models and hands-on exercises
                 that help clarify and illustrate more abstract math.''

                 core science, technology and engineering subjects is
                 often removed from both the practice of the disciplines
                 being taught and the technology tools which pervade
                 other aspects of their life. A significant challenge is
                 to reconnect the excitement and discovery that drew
                 faculty into their disciplines back to the learning
                 environments of STEM and CSE students they teach. Peer
                 Instruction (inserting discussion and formative
                 assessment into lecture) and project-based learning are
                 two promising attempts at recapturing the process of
                 science and engineering in introductory courses. Recent
                 experiments in freshman project-based seminars such as
                 nanoscale engineering and a major redesign of the
                 introductory Course 6 (Computer Science and Electrical
                 Engineering) at MIT are exploring ways to bring
                 apprenticeship back to both small and large classes.

                 digital study pack [3] which comprises a wealth of new,

                 described in recent ITiCSE and SIGCSE papers [4, 5].
                 ``Python First'' digital packs instances have already

  abstract =     "PyTrilinos is a collection of Python modules that are
                 useful for serial and parallel scientific computing.
                 This collection contains modules that cover serial and
                 parallel dense linear algebra, serial and parallel
                 sparse linear algebra, direct and iterative linear
                 solution techniques, domain decomposition and
                 multilevel preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, and
                 continuation algorithms. Also included are a variety of
                 related utility functions and classes, including
                 distributed I/O, coloring algorithms, and matrix
                 generation. PyTrilinos vector objects are integrated
                 with the popular NumPy Python module, gathering
                 together a variety of high-level distributed computing
                 operations with serial vector
                 operations.\par

                 PyTrilinos is a set of interfaces to existing, compiled
                 libraries. This hybrid framework uses Python as
                 front-end, and efficient precompiled libraries for all
                 computationally expensive tasks. Thus, we take
                 advantage of both the flexibility and ease of use of
                 Python, and the efficiency of the underlying C++, C,
                 and FORTRAN numerical kernels. Out numerical results
                 show that, for many important problem classes, the
                 overhead required by the Python interpreter is
                 negligible.\par

                 To run in parallel, PyTrilinos simply requires a
                 standard Python interpreter. The fundamental MPI calls
                 are encapsulated under an abstract layer that manages
                 all interprocessor communications. This makes serial
                 and parallel scripts using PyTrilinos virtually
                 identical.",

  abstract =     "The first year curriculum at the University of the
                 Witwatersrand (Wits) is a breadth-first curriculum
                 where students are introduced to a variety of topics in
                 Computer Science (see Sanders and Mueller [5] for
                 details). As part of the course the students are
                 expected to come to terms with a number of basic
                 algorithms and data structures which they are required
                 to implement. When the curriculum was designed we chose
                 Scheme as the implementation language. One reason for
                 doing so was because the main entrance requirement for
                 our course is a solid mathematics background as
                 evidenced by good marks at school level. Our students
                 thus have a good understanding of functions and we felt
                 that Scheme?s functional style would make it accessible
                 to all of our students. Another reason for choosing
                 Scheme was because it is a language which would be new
                 to all of our students. Scheme was well received by
                 those students who had never programmed before and
                 proved to be a good language for meeting our teaching
                 objectives but there was resistance to the language
                 from the students who could already program as they
                 considered it a waste of time to learn a language which
                 was not (as they believed) used in the real world [3].
                 In addition, the use of Scheme did not really reduce
                 the performance gap between the students with and
                 without prior programming experience [2]. Python has
                 been found to be a good first language for both
                 experienced and inexperienced users [4] and its simple
                 syntax and support of different programming paradigms
                 seemed to make it an attractive option for our first
                 year course. We believed that using Python would still
                 allow us to meet our educational objectives ? it would
                 be easily accessible to those students who had never
                 programmed before and would support our approach of
                 formulating algorithms Python has been found to be a
                 good first language for both experienced and
                 inexperienced users [4] and its simple syntax and
                 support of different programming paradigms seemed to
                 make it an attractive option for our first year course.
                 We believed that using Python would still allow us to
                 meet our educational objectives ? it would be easily
                 accessible to those students who had never programmed
                 before and would support our approach of formulating
                 algorithms In late 2007 we did a survey to assess the
                 first year students? impressions of Python. The
                 students were asked to indicate agreement, disagreement
                 or neutrality to a number of questions about the use of
                 Python. 55 students completed the survey ? 27 of these
                 had no prior programming experience and 28 had
                 programmed before. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was
                 used to test the hypotheses that both groups believed
                 that Python was a good first year language. The results
                 show strong evidence that the students feel that Python
                 is a suitable language. There are. however, still some
                 students with prior programming experience who are
                 resistant to new languages.",

  abstract =     "Within a few short years, we can expect to be dealing
                 with multi-million-thread programs running on
                 million-core systems [16]. This will no doubt stress
                 the contemporary HPC software model which was developed
                 in a time when 512 cores was a large number. Historical
                 approaches have been further challenged by the
                 increased desire of developers and end users for
                 supercomputer light weight kernels (LWKs) to support
                 the same environment, libraries, and tools as their
                 desktops. As a result, the emerging workloads of today
                 are far more sophisticated than those of the last two
                 decades when much of the HPC infrastructure was
                 developed, and feature the use of scripting
                 environments such as Python, dynamic libraries, and
                 complex multi-scale physics frameworks. Complicating
                 this picture is the overwhelming management, monitoring
                 and reliability problem created by the huge number of
                 nodes in a system of that magnitude.\par

                 We believe that a re-evaluation and exploration of
                 distributed system principals is called for in order to
                 address the challenges of ultrascale. To that end we
                 will be evaluating and extending the Plan 9 [21]
                 distributed system on the largest machines available to
                 us, namely the BG/L [28] and BG/P [10] supercomputers.
                 We have chosen Plan 9 based on our previous experiences
                 with it in combination with previous research [17]
                 which determined Plan 9 was a `right weight kernel',
                 balancing trade offs between LWKs and more general
                 purpose operating systems such as Linux. To deal with
                 issues of scale, we plan on leveraging the use of the
                 high-performance interconnects by system services as
                 well as exploring aggregation as more of a first-class
                 system construct -- providing dynamic hierarchical
                 organization and management of all resources. Our plan
                 is to evaluate the viability of these concepts at scale
                 as well as create an alternative development and
                 execution environment which compliments the features
                 and capabilities of the existing system software and
                 run time options. Our intent is to broaden the
                 application base as well as make the system as a whole
                 more approachable to a larger class of developers and
                 end-users.",

  abstract =     "How suitable is a Python-based CS1 course as
                 preparation for a C++-based CS2 course? After fifteen
                 years of using C++ for both CS1 and CS2, the Computer
                 Science Department at Michigan State University changed
                 the CS1 course to Python. This paper examines the
                 impact of that change on the second course in the
                 sequence, CS2, which kept C++ as its primary language.
                 We report results on a CS2 class which had a mixture of
                 students who had used either C++ or Python from our CS1
                 course. The CS2 class covered the same topics as
                 previously, though with some changes, and even gave the
                 same final exam as a previous offering. Independent
                 samples t-tests were used to compare students from the
                 Python group with students from the non-Python group on
                 three outcomes: final exam grade, programming projects
                 scores, and final grade for the course. The main result
                 was that there were no significant differences between
                 the groups for all three outcomes. In addition,
                 multiple regression analysis showed that students' past
                 performance (overall GPA) in the University predicted
                 final grades, final exam scores, and programming
                 project scores for the course, but there was no effect
                 of the programming language feature: Python or
                 non-Python. We feel this shows that the Python-based
                 CS1 course prepared students for the C++-based CS2
                 course as well as the C++-based CS1 course did---while
                 exposing them to a different, powerful and useful
                 language.",

  abstract =     "Many popular scripting languages such as Ruby, Python,
                 and Perl include highly dynamic language constructs,
                 such as an eval method that evaluates a string as
                 program text. While these constructs allow terse and
                 expressive code, they have traditionally obstructed
                 static analysis. In this paper we present PRuby, an
                 extension to Diamondback Ruby (DRuby), a static type
                 inference system for Ruby. PRuby augments DRuby with a
                 novel dynamic analysis and transformation that allows
                 us to precisely type uses of highly dynamic constructs.
                 PRuby's analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we use
                 run-time instrumentation to gather per-application
                 profiles of dynamic feature usage. Next, we replace
                 dynamic features with statically analyzable
                 alternatives based on the profile. We also add
                 instrumentation to safely handle cases when subsequent
                 runs do not match the profile. Finally, we run DRuby's
                 static type inference on the transformed code to
                 enforce type safety.\par

                 We used PRuby to gather profiles for a benchmark suite
                 of sample Ruby programs. We found that dynamic features
                 are pervasive throughout the benchmarks and the
                 libraries they include, but that most uses of these
                 features are highly constrained and hence can be
                 effectively profiled. Using the profiles to guide type
                 inference, we found that DRuby can generally statically
                 type our benchmarks modulo some refactoring, and we
                 discovered several previously unknown type errors.
                 These results suggest that profiling and transformation
                 is a lightweight but highly effective approach to bring
                 static typing to highly dynamic languages.",

                 computing and computational principles in scientific

                 visualization. Problems with a computational aspect are

                 this study, the students from whom data was collected
                 were at a university that had not provided data for
                 earlier studies. Also, the students were taught the
                 programming language ``Python'', which had not been

                 test of whether the findings in the earlier studies
                 were specific to certain institutions, student cohorts,
                 and programming languages. Also, we used a
                 non-parametric approach to the analysis, rather than
                 the linear approach of earlier studies. Our results are
                 consistent with the earlier studies. We found that
                 students who cannot trace code usually cannot explain
                 code, and also that students who tend to perform
                 reasonably well at code writing tasks have also usually
                 acquired the ability to both trace code and explain

  abstract =     "We present pyMDO, an object-oriented framework that
                 facilitates the usage and development of algorithms for
                 multidisciplinary optimization (MDO). The resulting
                 implementation of the MDO methods is efficient and
                 portable. The main advantage of the proposed framework
                 is that it is flexible, with a strong emphasis on
                 object-oriented classes and operator overloading, and
                 it is therefore useful for the rapid development and
                 evaluation of new MDO methods. The top layer interface
                 is programmed in Python and it allows for the layers
                 below the interface to be programmed in C, C++,
                 Fortran, and other languages. We describe an
                 implementation of pyMDO and demonstrate that we can
                 take advantage of object-oriented programming to obtain
                 intuitive, easy-to-read, and easy-to-develop codes that
                 are at the same time efficient. This allows developers
                 to focus on the new algorithms they are developing and
                 testing, rather than on implementation details.
                 Examples demonstrate the user interface and the
                 corresponding results show that the various MDO methods
                 yield the correct solutions.",

                 Thinking of a project with a high integrity kernel

                 a middleware solution, such as SOAP or CORBA We?ll see
                 how the communication can be manually done using low

  abstract =     "High-level languages are growing in popularity.
                 However, decades of C software development have
                 produced large libraries of fast, time-tested,
                 meritorious code that are impractical to recreate from
                 scratch. Cross-language bindings can expose low-level C
                 code to high-level languages. Unfortunately, writing
                 bindings by hand is tedious and error-prone, while
                 mainstream binding generators require extensive manual
                 annotation or fail to offer the language features that
                 users of modern languages have come to expect.\par

                 We present an improved binding-generation strategy
                 based on static analysis of unannotated library source
                 code. We characterize three high-level idioms that are
                 not uniquely expressible in C's low-level type system:
                 array parameters, resource managers, and multiple
                 return values. We describe a suite of interprocedural
                 analyses that recover this high-level information, and
                 we show how the results can be used in a binding
                 generator for the Python programming language. In
                 experiments with four large C libraries, we find that
                 our approach avoids the mistakes characteristic of
                 hand-written bindings while offering a level of Python
                 integration unmatched by prior automated approaches.
                 Among the thousands of functions in the public
                 interfaces of these libraries, roughly 40\% exhibit the
                 behaviors detected by our static analyses.",

                 programming language. Mython achieves extensibility by
                 adding a quotation mechanism that accepts an additional
                 parameter as well as the code being quoted. The
                 additional quotation parameter takes the form of a
                 Mython expression. Unlike other user code, Mython
                 evaluates the quotation parameter at compile-time. The
                 result of the compile-time expression is a function
                 that is used to both parse the quoted code, and extend
                 the compile-time environment. By explicitly passing the
                 compilation environment to compile-time quotation
                 functions, Mython's parameterized quotation allows
                 users to inject code into the language compiler.
                 Injected code can extend the language by modifying the
                 compilation phases, which are visible to the
                 compilation environment. The Mython language is
                 realized by the MyFront compiler, a tool for
                 translating Mython into Python byte-code modules. This

  abstract =     "Languages such as Java and C\#, as well as scripting
                 languages like Python, and Ruby, make extensive use of
                 Collection classes. A collection implementation
                 represents a fixed choice in the dimensions of
                 operation time, space utilization, and synchronization.
                 Using the collection in a manner not consistent with
                 this fixed choice can cause significant performance
                 degradation. In this paper, we present CHAMELEON, a
                 low-overhead automatic tool that assists the programmer
                 in choosing the appropriate collection implementation
                 for her application. During program execution,
                 CHAMELEON computes elaborate trace and heap-based
                 metrics on collection behavior. These metrics are
                 consumed on-the-fly by a rules engine which outputs a
                 list of suggested collection adaptation strategies. The
                 tool can apply these corrective strategies
                 automatically or present them to the programmer. We
                 have implemented CHAMELEON on top of a IBM's J9
                 production JVM, and evaluated it over a small set of
                 benchmarks. We show that for some applications, using
                 CHAMELEON leads to a significant improvement of the
                 memory footprint of the application.",

  abstract =     "Over the past decade there has been a surge of
                 academic and industrial interest in optimistic
                 concurrency, {\em i.e.\/} the speculative parallel
                 execution of code regions that have the semantics of
                 isolation. This work analyzes scalability bottlenecks
                 of workloads that use optimistic concurrency. We find
                 that one common bottleneck is updates to auxiliary
                 program data in otherwise non-conflicting operations,
                 {\em e.g.\/} reference count updates and hashtable
                 occupancy field increments.\par

                 To eliminate the performance impact of conflicts on
                 such auxiliary data, this work proposes RETCON, a
                 hardware mechanism that tracks the relationship between
                 input and output values symbolically and uses this
                 symbolic information to transparently repair the output
                 state of a transaction at commit. RETCON is inspired by
                 instruction replay-based mechanisms but exploits
                 simplifying properties of the nature of computations on
                 auxiliary data to perform repair {\em without\/}
                 replay. Our experiments show that RETCON provides
                 significant speedups for workloads that exhibit
                 conflicts on auxiliary data, including transforming a
                 transactionalized version of the Python interpreter
                 from a workload that exhibits no scaling to one that
                 exhibits near-linear scaling on 32 cores.",

                 written more easily using high-level constructs such as
                 comprehensions for queries and using generic code.
                 Efficient execution of programs then requires powerful
                 optimizations - incrementalization of expensive queries
                 and specialization of generic code. Effective
                 incrementalization and specialization of dynamic
                 languages require precise and scalable alias analysis.
                 This paper describes the development and experimental
                 evaluation of a may-alias analysis for a full dynamic
                 object-oriented language, for program optimization by
                 incrementalization and specialization. The analysis is
                 flow-sensitive; we show that this is necessary for

                 precise type analysis and a powerful form of context

                 improve analysis precision.",

  abstract =     "Programming language specifications mandate static and
                 dynamic analyses to preclude syntactic and semantic
                 errors. Although individual languages are usually
                 well-specified, composing languages is not, and this
                 poor specification is a source of many errors in {\em
                 multilingual\/} programs. For example, virtually all
                 Java programs compose Java and C using the Java Native
                 Interface (JNI). Since JNI is informally specified,
                 developers have difficulty using it correctly, and
                 current Java compilers and virtual machines (VMs)
                 inconsistently check only a subset of JNI
                 constraints.\par

                 This paper's most significant contribution is to show
                 how to synthesize dynamic analyses from state machines
                 to detect foreign function interface (FFI) violations.
                 We identify three classes of FFI constraints encoded by
                 eleven state machines that capture thousands of JNI and
                 Python/C FFI rules. We use a mapping function to
                 specify which state machines, transitions, and program
                 entities (threads, objects, references) to check at
                 each FFI call and return. From this function, we
                 synthesize a context-specific dynamic analysis to find
                 FFI bugs. We build bug detection tools for JNI and
                 Python/C using this approach. For JNI, we dynamically
                 and transparently interpose the analysis on Java and C
                 language transitions through the JVM tools interface.
                 The resulting tool, called Jinn, is compiler and
                 virtual machine {\em independent}. It detects and
                 diagnoses a wide variety of FFI bugs that other tools
                 miss. This approach greatly reduces the annotation
                 burden by exploiting common FFI constraints: whereas
                 the generated Jinn code is 22,000+ lines, we wrote only
                 1,400 lines of state machine and mapping code. Overall,
                 this paper lays the foundation for a more principled
                 approach to developing correct multilingual software
                 and a more concise and automated approach to FFI
                 specification.",

                 the reference Python implementation. CPython protects
                 its data structures using a single global lock, which

                 We modified the CPython interpreter to use best-effort
                 hardware transactions available in Sun's Rock
                 processor, and fall back on the single global lock when

                 CPython's shared data structures to handle false
                 conflicts arising from CPython's management of the

                 dynamic scripting languages such as Perl, PHP, Python,
                 and Ruby. For general purpose scripting language usage,
                 interpreter-based implementations are efficient and
                 popular but the server-side usage for Web application
                 development implies an opportunity to significantly
                 enhance Web server throughput. This paper summarizes a
                 study of the optimization of PHP script processing. We
                 developed a PHP processor, P9, by adapting an existing
                 production-quality just-in-time (JIT) compiler for a
                 Java virtual machine, for which optimization
                 technologies have been well-established, especially for
                 server-side application. This paper describes and
                 contrasts microbenchmarks and SPECweb2005 benchmark
                 results for a well-tuned configuration of a traditional
                 PHP interpreter and our JIT compiler-based
                 implementation, P9. Experimental results with the
                 microbenchmarks show 2.5-9.5x advantage with P9, and
                 the SPECweb2005 measurements show about 20-30\%
                 improvements. These results show that the acceleration
                 of dynamic scripting language processing does matter in
                 a realistic Web application server environment. CPU
                 usage profiling shows our simple JIT compiler
                 introduction reduces the PHP core runtime overhead from
                 45\% to 13\% for a SPECweb2005 scenario, implying that
                 further improvements of dynamic compilers would provide
                 little additional return unless other major overheads
                 such as heavy memory copy between the language runtime
                 and Web server frontend are reduced.",

  abstract =     "This article describes the algorithms, features, and
                 implementation of PyDEC, a Python library for
                 computations related to the discretization of exterior
                 calculus. PyDEC facilitates inquiry into both physical
                 problems on manifolds as well as purely topological
                 problems on abstract complexes. We describe efficient
                 algorithms for constructing the operators and objects
                 that arise in discrete exterior calculus, lowest-order
                 finite element exterior calculus, and in related
                 topological problems. Our algorithms are formulated in
                 terms of high-level matrix operations which extend to
                 arbitrary dimension. As a result, our implementations
                 map well to the facilities of numerical libraries such
                 as NumPy and SciPy. The availability of such libraries
                 makes Python suitable for prototyping numerical
                 methods. We demonstrate how PyDEC is used to solve
                 physical and topological problems through several
                 concise examples.",

  abstract =     "Whenever the need to compile a new dynamically typed
                 language arises, an appealing option is to repurpose an
                 existing statically typed language Just-In-Time (JIT)
                 compiler (repurposed JIT compiler). Existing repurposed
                 JIT compilers (RJIT compilers), however, have not yet
                 delivered the hoped-for performance boosts. The
                 performance of JVM languages, for instance, often lags
                 behind standard interpreter implementations. Even more
                 customized solutions that extend the internals of a JIT
                 compiler for the target language compete poorly with
                 those designed specifically for dynamically typed
                 languages. Our own Fiorano JIT compiler is an example
                 of this problem. As a state-of-the-art, RJIT compiler
                 for Python, the Fiorano JIT compiler outperforms two
                 other RJIT compilers (Unladen Swallow and Jython), but
                 still shows a noticeable performance gap compared to
                 PyPy, today's best performing Python JIT compiler. In
                 this paper, we discuss techniques that have proved
                 effective in the Fiorano JIT compiler as well as
                 limitations of our current implementation. More
                 importantly, this work offers the first in-depth look
                 at benefits and limitations of the repurposed JIT
                 compiler approach. We believe the most common pitfall
                 of existing RJIT compilers is not focusing sufficiently
                 on specialization, an abundant optimization opportunity
                 unique to dynamically typed languages. Unfortunately,
                 the lack of specialization cannot be overcome by
                 applying traditional optimizations.",

                 contemporary development processes since they describe
                 a software system's expected behavior from the
                 perspective of its prospective users. However, the
                 presence of and traceability to use-cases is
                 increasingly lost in later more code-centric
                 development activities. Use-cases, being
                 well-encapsulated at the level of requirements
                 descriptions, eventually lead to crosscutting concerns
                 in system design and source code. Tracing which parts
                 of the system contribute to which use-cases is
                 therefore hard and so limits understandability. In this
                 paper, we propose an approach to making use-cases
                 first-class entities in both the programming language
                 and the runtime environment. Having use-cases present
                 in the code and the running system will allow
                 developers, maintainers, and operators to easily
                 associate their units of work with what matters to the
                 users. We suggest the combination of use-cases,
                 acceptance tests, and dynamic analysis to automatically
                 associate source code with use-cases. We present
                 UseCasePy, an implementation of our approach to
                 use-case-centered development in Python, and its

                 dynamic content with client-side interactive programs.
                 Dynamically --- typed languages have gained a lot of
                 ground in both of these domains. The growth of Web 2.0
                 has introduced a myriad of websites which contain
                 personalized content, which is specific to the user.
                 PHP or Python programs generate the actual HTML page
                 after querying a database and processing the results,
                 which are then presented by the browser. It is becoming
                 more and more vital to accelerate the execution of
                 these programs, as this is a significant part of the
                 total time needed to present the page to the user. This
                 paper presents a novel interpreter for the PHP language
                 written in RPython, which the PyPy translator then
                 translates into C. The translator integrates into the

                 optimizes the hottest loops in the interpreted
                 programs. We also describe a data model that supports
                 all the data types in the PHP language, such as
                 references and iterators. We evaluate the performance
                 of this interpreter, showing that speedups up to a
                 factor of 8 are observed using this approach.",

  abstract =     "Applications written in dynamically typed scripting
                 languages are increasingly popular for Web software
                 development. Even on the server side, programmers are
                 using dynamically typed scripting languages such as
                 Ruby and Python to build complex applications quickly.
                 As the number and complexity of dynamically typed
                 scripting language applications grows, optimizing their
                 performance is becoming important. Some of the best
                 performing compilers and optimizers for dynamically
                 typed scripting languages are developed entirely from
                 scratch and target a specific language. This approach
                 is not scalable, given the variety of dynamically typed
                 scripting languages, and the effort involved in
                 developing and maintaining separate infrastructures for
                 each. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of
                 adapting and extending an existing production-quality
                 method-based Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for a language
                 with dynamic types. Our goal is to identify the
                 challenges and shortcomings with the current
                 infrastructure, and to propose and evaluate runtime
                 techniques and optimizations that can be incorporated
                 into a common optimization infrastructure for static
                 and dynamic languages. We discuss three extensions to
                 the compiler to support dynamically typed languages:
                 (1) simplification of control flow graphs, (2) mapping
                 of memory locations to stack-allocated variables, and
                 (3) reduction of runtime overhead using language
                 semantics. We also propose four new optimizations for
                 Python in (2) and (3). These extensions are effective
                 in reduction of compiler working memory and improvement
                 of runtime performance. We present a detailed
                 performance evaluation of our approach for Python,
                 finding an overall improvement of 1.69x on average (up
                 to 2.74x) over our JIT compiler without any
                 optimization for dynamically typed languages and
                 Python.",

                 on refining the given edge labels and on assessing the
                 data quality. The results are aimed at being
                 exploitable for experimental design and include the
                 prediction of new activatory or inhibitory effects of
                 given interactions and yet unobserved oscillations of
                 specific components in between specific sampling
                 intervals. On the formal side, we generalize the
                 concept of edge labels and introduce a discrete time
                 series interpretation. This interpretation features two
                 original concepts: 1) Incomplete measurements are
                 admissible, and 2) it allows qualitative assumptions
                 about the changes in gene expression by means of
                 monotonicity. On the computational side, we provide a

                 mixture using tandem mass spectrometry can be framed as
                 an inference problem on a graph that connects peptides
                 to proteins. Several existing protein identification
                 methods make use of statistical inference methods for
                 graphical models, including expectation maximization,

                 usually comes from a few highly connected subgraphs.

  abstract =     "Dynamic type-checking and object-oriented programming
                 often go hand-in-hand; scripting languages such as
                 Python, Ruby, and JavaScript all embrace
                 object-oriented (OO) programming. When scripts written
                 in such languages grow and evolve into large programs,
                 the lack of a static type discipline reduces
                 maintainability. A programmer may thus wish to migrate
                 parts of such scripts to a sister language with a
                 static type system. Unfortunately, existing type
                 systems neither support the flexible OO composition
                 mechanisms found in scripting languages nor accommodate
                 sound interoperation with untyped code. In this paper,
                 we present the design of a gradual typing system that
                 supports sound interaction between statically- and
                 dynamically-typed units of class-based code. The type
                 system uses row polymorphism for classes and thus
                 supports mixin-based OO composition. To protect
                 migration of mixins from typed to untyped components,
                 the system employs a novel form of contracts that
                 partially seal classes. The design comes with a theorem
                 that guarantees the soundness of the type system even
                 in the presence of untyped components.",

  abstract =     "Computing the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix is a
                 problem that arises in various fields of physics. Both
                 computing the Pfaffian and a related problem, computing
                 the canonical form of a skew-symmetric matrix under
                 unitary congruence, can be solved easily once the
                 skew-symmetric matrix has been reduced to
                 skew-symmetric tridiagonal form. We develop efficient
                 numerical methods for computing this tridiagonal form
                 based on Gaussian elimination, using a skew-symmetric,
                 blocked form of the Parlett-Reid algorithm, or based on
                 unitary transformations, using block Householder
                 transformations and Givens rotations, that are
                 applicable to dense and banded matrices, respectively.
                 We also give a complete and fully optimized
                 implementation of these algorithms in Fortran
                 (including a C interface), and also provide Python,
                 Matlab and Mathematica implementations for convenience.
                 Finally, we apply these methods to compute the
                 topological charge of a class D nanowire, and show
                 numerically the equivalence of definitions based on the
                 Hamiltonian and the scattering matrix.",

                 behind the FEniCS Project and explores an advanced,
                 expressive approach to the development of mathematical
                 software. The presentation spans mathematical
                 background, software design and the use of FEniCS in
                 applications. Theoretical aspects are complemented with
                 computer code which is available as free/open source
                 software. The book begins with a tutorial for readers
                 who are new to the topic. Following the tutorial,
                 chapters in Part I address fundamental aspects of the
                 approach to automating the creation of finite element
                 solvers. Chapters in Part II address the design and
                 implementation of the FEnicS software. Chapters in Part
                 III present the application of FEniCS to a wide range
                 of applications, including fluid flow, solid mechanics,
                 electromagnetics and geophysics.",
